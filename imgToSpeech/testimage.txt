Before

With his invention of the printing press, Gutenberg was
the first European to use movable type printing, in
around 1439. Among his many contributions to printing
are: the invention of a process for mass-producing
movable type; the use of oil-based ink; and the use of a
‘wooden printing press similar to the agricultural screw
presses of the period. His truly epochal invention was
the combination of these elements into a practical system.
that allowed the mass production of printed books and
‘was economically viable for printers and readers alike.
Gutenberg’ method for making type is traditionally
considered to have included a type metal alloy and a
hand mould for casting type. The alloy was a mixture of
lead, tin, and antimony that melted at a relatively low
‘temperature for faster and more economical casting, cast
well, and created a durable type.
